# ✈️ Flight Ticket Price Prediction (Indonesia)

This project predicts domestic airline ticket prices in Indonesia using three tree-based machine learning models: Regression Tree, Bagging Regression Tree, and Random Forest. The study focuses on two routes: Jakarta–Surabaya and Jakarta–Manado, using flight data collected from tiket.com between June and August 2022.

## 📌 Features

- Predictive modeling with tree-based ML algorithms
- Model tuning using cross-validation
- Model evaluation using MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and R²
- Interactive web app built with R Shiny for price prediction

## 🧪 Results

Random Forest performed best for both routes with the lowest error rates.

## 🖥️ Web App R Shiny

The app allows users to input flight parameters and outputs predicted ticket prices using all three models.
